Welcome to my personal portfolio! This repository showcases my skills, projects, and services, with a focus on **Cybersecurity**, **Ethical Hacking**, **Machine Learning**, and **Web Development**. The portfolio is fully responsive and built using **HTML**, **CSS (TailwindCSS)**, and **JavaScript**. It also integrates **Formspree** for the contact form section.
