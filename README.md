# Arya's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This repository showcases my skills, projects, and services, with a focus on **Cybersecurity**, **Ethical Hacking**, **Machine Learning**, and **Web Development**. The portfolio is fully responsive and built using **HTML**, **CSS (TailwindCSS)**, and **JavaScript**. It also integrates **Formspree** for the contact form section.

## Features

- **Fully Responsive**: The portfolio adjusts seamlessly across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Hero Section**: An animated, interactive section introducing myself.
- **Skills Section**: Showcases technical skills with icons and animations.
- **Projects Section**: Displays a collection of my work in cybersecurity and machine learning.
- **Contact Section**: Includes a contact form with Formspree integration for form submissions.
- **Smooth Animations**: Subtle animations are applied across sections for a modern look and feel.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For semantic structure and content.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for responsive design and styling.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic interactions like animations, form submission, and alerts.
- **Formspree**: Serverless form handling to send form data directly to an email without server setup.
- **Font Awesome**: For icons used across the portfolio.
